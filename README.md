# Huffman-Coding-Data-Compression

A group project implementing Huffman Coding for data compression. This project demonstrates how to efficiently encode and decode data using variable-length prefix codes to reduce storage size of multiple files.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives

    âœ… Simple and User-Friendly GUI

        Allow users to easily select and compress/decompress multiple files.

        Support drag-and-drop or file selection.

    âœ… File Integrity with Checksum

        Generate a checksum (like SHA-256) for each file during compression.

        Verify the checksum during decompression to detect corruption.

    âœ… Preserve File Metadata

        Save file name, size, and last modified date.

        Restore all metadata when files are decompressed.

    âœ… Support Multiple Files in One Archive

        Combine multiple files into a single compressed file.

        Decompress all files from the archive easily.
